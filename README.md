[jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks to accompnay a reading group in Scala. To run these notebooks you will need to install jupyter with the [Scala kernel](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala).

* jupyter recommends Python 3. If you are on a Mac you can use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) to install Python3: `brew install python3`
* Use pip to install jupyter: `pip3 install jupyter`
* Follow the instructions on the [github page](https://github.com/alexarchambault/jupyter-scala) to download the Scala kernel. Extract the archive file and run `jupyter-scala` to install the kernel. If this works correctly, then you should see Scala in the list printed by `jupyter kernelspec list`.
* In your copy of this repository, run `jupyter notebook`. This will open a browser page displaying jupyter's graphical interface. From here you can open and work through the notebooks in this repository. Here is a nice [cheat sheet](https://sowingseasons.com/blog/reference/2016/01/jupyter-keyboard-shortcuts/23298516) for jupyter commands.
